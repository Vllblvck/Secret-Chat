# Secret-Chat
Simple chat application written in Java.
You can use it to have more private conversations with your friends as there is no spying from big companies.

# What I learned
-using sockets in java\
-basics of javafx\
-practiced thread using and increased my knowledge about them\
-increased my knowledge about streams in java\
-basics of using github

# TODO
-add database support for keeping accounts instead of text file\
-make GUI less rubbish\
-add basic encryption for messages

# Usage
-configure SERVER_PORT variable in Server class\
-configure socket variable in Client class\
-configure FILE_PATH variable in Server class (path leads to text file where client accounts are stored in format "username|password\n", at least for now)\
-compile Server and Window class\
